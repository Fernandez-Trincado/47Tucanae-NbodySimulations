Abstract
---

The most accurate 6D phase-space information from the Radial Velocity Experiment (RAVE) was used to integrate the orbits of
105 stars around the galactic globular cluster 47 Tucanae, over the distance range 2 kpc $ < d < $ 6 kpc. Using the uncertainties in the current position and velocity vector for both the star and cluster, 10$^{5}$ pairs of star-cluster orbits were generated in a Monte Carlo numerical scheme. We integrated the orbits over 1000 Myr and 300 Myr, considering an axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric Milky-Way-like Galactic potential, respectively, and looked for close encounters in the past with a minimum distance approach less than the cluster tidal radius, between stars in the RAVE survey around 47 Tucanae and the cluster itself. In this scheme, we identified 30 potential cluster members that had close encounters with the globular cluster 47 Tucanae, all of which are shown to have a relative velocity distribution $(V_{rel})$ less than 200 kms$^{-1}$. Among these potential members, 9 had close encounters with the cluster with velocities less than the escape velocity of 47 Tucanae, therefore a scenario of "tidal stripping" seems likely, while for the other 21 stars $V_{rel}$ exceeds the escape velocity of the cluster, therefore they were likely "ejected". The number of stars found in and out the tidal radius during our simulations, is comparable to the escape rate for 47 Tucanae estimated to be about 14 stars per Myr.
